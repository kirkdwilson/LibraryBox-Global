# LibraryBox-HTML-Pages
LibraryBox UI overhaul for illiterate people around the world.

There are a number of key objectives for a redesign of the HTML/CSS pages:

1) Keep the responsive design.<br>
2) Adapt the interface for non-literate users to easily navigate content.<br>
3) Keep the L10 multi-lingual interface active and in use on textual components.<br>
4) Adapt the HTML/CSS code to enable easily branding by other organizations.<br>
